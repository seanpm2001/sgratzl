### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam. I'm a research software engineer and data visualization consultant from Austria. I develop tools and libraries that allow users to show their data in a new light and help them to discover new insights.

I create and maintain specialized visualization libraries such as [LineUp.js](https://github.com/lineupjs) or [UpSet.js](https://github.com/upsetjs). In addition, I contribute and create plugins for web visualization frameworks such as [chart.js](https://github.com/sgratzl?tab=repositories&q=chartjs) or [cytoscape.js](https://github.com/sgratzl?tab=repositories&q=cytoscape).

I'm currently looking for new projects and a new job preferable in a R&D area.

Contact me via [mail](mailto:sam@sgratzl.com)
