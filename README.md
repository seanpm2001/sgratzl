### Hol√°

I'm Sam.
I'm a research software engineer with a focus on interactive data exploration.
I'm a Full Stack Developer with 10+ years of experience.
In 2017, I finished his PhD in Computer Science with a focus on Information Visualization at the Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria.
I love to dig into code, hunt bugs, and design new platforms.
My goal is enabling researcher to discover more insights easier and faster as well as develop libraries that help others developers to do the same.

I create and maintain specialized visualization libraries such as [LineUp-lite](https://github.com/sgratzl/lineup-lite), [LineUp.js](https://github.com/lineupjs) or [UpSet.js](https://github.com/upsetjs). In addition, I contribute and create plugins for web visualization frameworks such as [chart.js](https://github.com/sgratzl?tab=repositories&q=chartjs) or [cytoscape.js](https://github.com/sgratzl?tab=repositories&q=cytoscape).
